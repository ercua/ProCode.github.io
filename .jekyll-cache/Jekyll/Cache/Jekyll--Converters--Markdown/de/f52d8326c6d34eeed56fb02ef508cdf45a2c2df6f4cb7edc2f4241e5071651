I"¯<p>Letâ€™s say weâ€™re outputting heading string in multiple places across this page but each time, we want the output to be slightly different.
Replace
In this first instance, instead of saying â€œbaked goodsâ€ we want it to say â€œbaked breadâ€. This is an excellent use case for Liquid filters.
To use a filter weâ€™ll add a â€œ|â€ after the variable then pass it a filter, replace in this case:
â€¦</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>â€¦</p>
